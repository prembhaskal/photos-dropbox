# Photos to Dropbox
app to transfer my pics from photos to dropbox to avoid reaching limit.


### running in local
```
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd ishancraft_handmade
$ http-server
```
  
open http://localhost:8080 in chrome/firefox.  

NOTE: The port 19080 exists in code because of my current testing environment in window which is port-fowarding from virtualbox.
